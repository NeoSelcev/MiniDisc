# Settings Modal Conversion

## Date: 2025-10-22

## Changes Made

Converted Settings from a separate page to a modal popup with live preview functionality.

### 1. Created New SettingsModal Component

**File:** `src/components/SettingsModal.jsx`

**Key Features:**
- **Modal overlay** with backdrop click-to-close
- **Live updates** - changes apply immediately to the main page (no "Save" button needed)
- **Escape key** to close (keyboard accessible)
- **Body scroll prevention** when modal is open
- **Responsive design** - scrollable content, max height 90vh
- **Sticky header/footer** - always visible even when scrolling settings
- **Direct state updates** - calls `updateSettings()` on every change (no local state buffer)

**Sections:**
1. Spotify Integration Setup (help text)
2. Sticker Dimensions (5 sticker types)
3. Typography Settings (6 font sizes)
4. Print Settings (DPI, spacing, margins, toggles)

**Removed:**
- "Save" button (live updates make it unnecessary)
- "Cancel" button (replaced with "Close")
- Local state (`localSettings`) - now updates global state directly

### 2. Updated App.jsx

**Changes:**
- Removed hash-based routing for settings page
- Added `showSettings` state for modal visibility
- Removed Settings page route
- Added `<SettingsModal>` component at app root
- Added keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl+,** to open settings
- Passes `onOpenSettings` prop to Header

**Routing:**
- Only `/callback` route remains (for Spotify OAuth)
- Main page is always visible (no page switching)

### 3. Updated Header.jsx

**Changes:**
- Removed settings navigation links (both mobile and desktop)
- Added `onOpenSettings` prop
- Replaced `<a href="#settings">` with `<button onClick={onOpenSettings}>`
- Removed "Editor" link (no longer needed since settings is a modal)
- Simplified navigation (no route highlighting)

### 4. Benefits

**Live Preview:**
✅ See dimension changes instantly on the layout
✅ See font size changes on sticker previews
✅ See margin changes on the A4 preview
✅ See spacing changes immediately
✅ No need to switch pages back and forth

**Better UX:**
✅ Modal stays on top of the main content
✅ Can see both settings and preview at once (on large screens)
✅ Keyboard accessible (Escape to close, Ctrl+, to open)
✅ Click outside to close
✅ No page navigation confusion
✅ Faster workflow for adjusting settings

**Technical:**
✅ Simpler code (no local state management)
✅ Immediate updates to Zustand store
✅ Undo/redo still works for settings changes
✅ Settings persist to localStorage on every change

### 5. User Workflows

**Opening Settings:**
- Click "⚙️ Settings" button in header (mobile or desktop)
- Press **Ctrl+,** (keyboard shortcut)

**Adjusting Settings:**
1. Change any value in the modal
2. See the change instantly on the main page behind the modal

**Typography Testing:**

2. Change "Track List" font size
3. See track names update size in the preview
4. Adjust until text fits nicely
5. Close modal when done

### 6. Removed Files

The old `Settings.jsx` page-based component can be deleted (replaced by `SettingsModal.jsx`).

### 7. Migration Notes

**No Breaking Changes:**
- All settings functionality preserved
- Settings structure unchanged
- Zustand persistence still works
- All keyboard shortcuts maintained
- Spotify setup instructions still visible

**What Users Will Notice:**
- Settings now opens as a popup instead of a new page
- Changes apply immediately (no "Save Settings" alert)
- Can see the main page while adjusting settings
- Faster iteration when tweaking dimensions/fonts

### 8. Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
1. **Split settings tabs** - Dimensions | Typography | Print (for easier navigation)
2. **Preview zoom** - Show zoomed preview of one sticker while editing
3. **Preset dimensions** - Quick presets for common MiniDisc sizes
4. **Font preview** - Show sample text at different font sizes
5. **Undo/redo in modal** - Show undo/redo buttons in settings header
6. **Setting search** - Filter settings by keyword

## Files Modified

- **NEW:** `src/components/SettingsModal.jsx` - Modal version of settings
- **MODIFIED:** `src/App.jsx` - Removed page routing, added modal state

## Conclusion

- **Immediate updates** make fine-tuning dimensions much faster

Users can now experiment with different settings and see results instantly, making it much easier to optimize their MiniDisc sticker layouts!
