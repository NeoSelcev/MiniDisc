# üéµ How to Get Your Spotify Token - Simple Guide

## Quick Answer: You Don't Manually Get a Token!

**The app will automatically get your Spotify token when you connect.** You just need to set up your Spotify App credentials first.

## Step-by-Step Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create a Spotify Developer App

1. **Go to Spotify Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
   - Log in with your Spotify account (you need Spotify Premium)

2. **Create Your App**
   - Click the green **"Create app"** button
   - Fill in the form:
     - **App name**: `MiniDisc Sticker Printer` (or any name)
     - **App description**: `Personal app for creating MiniDisc stickers`
     - **Website**: Leave blank or use `http://localhost`
     - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:5173/callback` ‚ö†Ô∏è **MUST BE EXACT**
   - Check the agreement checkbox
   - Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Get Your Credentials

1. On your new app's page, you'll see:
   - **Client ID** - A long string like `abc123def456...`
   - **Client Secret** - Click "Show Client Secret" to reveal it

2. **Copy both values** - you'll need them in the next step

### Step 3: Add Them to Your .env File

1. Open the `.env` file in your project folder
2. Replace the placeholder values:

```env
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=paste_your_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=paste_your_client_secret_here
VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173/callback
PORT=3001
```

3. Save the file

### Step 4: Restart the App

```bash
# Stop the current servers (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev:all
```

### Step 5: Connect Spotify in the App

1. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
2. Click **"Connect Spotify"** button
3. You'll be redirected to Spotify's login page
4. Click **"Agree"** to authorize the app
5. You'll be redirected back to your app
6. **The token is automatically generated and stored!**

## üîê Where Is My Token Stored?

Your Spotify token is automatically:
- ‚úÖ Generated when you click "Connect Spotify"
- ‚úÖ Stored in your browser's localStorage
- ‚úÖ Refreshed automatically when it expires
- ‚úÖ Never exposed in the code

**You never need to manually handle the token!**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

### Issue: "Redirect URI not secure" warning
**Solution**: This is normal! Spotify allows `http://localhost` for development. Just click "Save" anyway.

### Issue: "Invalid redirect URI" error
**Solution**: Make sure the redirect URI in:
1. Spotify Dashboard: `http://localhost:5173/callback`
2. .env file: `VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173/callback`

**Both must be EXACTLY the same** (no spaces, no trailing slash).

### Issue: "Invalid client" error
**Solution**: 
1. Double-check your Client ID and Secret in `.env`
2. Make sure you copied them correctly (no extra spaces)
3. Restart the app: `npm run dev:all`

### Issue: App says "Connect Spotify" but nothing happens
**Solution**: 
1. Make sure the backend server is running (you should see both servers in terminal)
2. Check the browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
3. Verify your .env file has both Client ID and Secret

## üéØ Testing the Connection

After connecting Spotify:

1. Click **"Add Album"** in the app
2. Search for an album name (e.g., "Thriller")
3. Results should appear from Spotify
4. Click an album to auto-populate all data

If this works, **you're all set!**

## üîÑ Token Lifecycle

1. **First time**: You click "Connect Spotify" ‚Üí App redirects to Spotify ‚Üí You authorize ‚Üí Token generated
2. **Using the app**: Token is used for all Spotify API calls
3. **After 1 hour**: Token expires ‚Üí App automatically refreshes it
4. **If refresh fails**: You'll see a message to reconnect

## üö´ Don't Want to Use Spotify?

You can skip the Spotify integration entirely!

- Click "Add Album" ‚Üí "Manual Entry"
- Fill in album details manually
- Upload your own album cover image
- Add tracks manually

The app works 100% without Spotify!

## Summary: The 3 Things You Need

1. ‚úÖ **Client ID** (from Spotify Dashboard)
2. ‚úÖ **Client Secret** (from Spotify Dashboard)  
3. ‚úÖ **Redirect URI** set to `http://localhost:5173/callback` (in both places)

**That's it! The app handles everything else automatically.** üéâ
