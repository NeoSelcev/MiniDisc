# ⚠️ Redirect URI "Not Secure" Warning - SAFE TO IGNORE

## What You're Seeing

When you add `http://localhost:5173/callback` to your Spotify App's Redirect URIs, you may see a warning message:

> ⚠️ "This redirect URI is not secure. Learn more here."

## This is COMPLETELY NORMAL and SAFE to ignore for local development!

### Why Does This Warning Appear?

Spotify shows this warning because:
1. The URI uses `http://` instead of `https://`
2. Spotify's production apps should use HTTPS for security

### Why Is It Safe for Localhost?

**Spotify OFFICIALLY SUPPORTS `http://localhost` for development:**

From [Spotify's Official Documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/authorization):
> "For local development, redirect URIs can use `http://localhost` with any port."

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Localhost traffic never leaves your computer - no network vulnerability
- ✅ Your credentials are safe - they're only in your local `.env` file
- ✅ This is standard practice for OAuth development
- ✅ Spotify explicitly allows and expects this for development

### What About Production?

If you were deploying this app publicly, you would:
1. Get a domain name (e.g., `minidisc-printer.com`)
2. Set up HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate
3. Update the redirect URI to `https://minidisc-printer.com/callback`
4. Update your `.env` file with the new URI

**But for personal/local use, `http://localhost` is perfect!**

## Summary

| Environment | URI Example | Security | Spotify Support |
|------------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **Local Development** | `http://localhost:5173/callback` | ✅ Safe (local only) | ✅ Officially supported |
| **Production** | `https://yourdomain.com/callback` | ✅ Encrypted | ✅ Required |

## How to Proceed

1. **Ignore the warning** - Click "Save" or "Add" in Spotify Dashboard
2. The redirect URI will be added successfully
3. Your app will work perfectly for local development
4. Your data is completely secure

## Still Concerned?

Remember:
- This app runs **100% locally** on your laptop
- No data is sent to external servers (except Spotify API calls)
- Your Spotify credentials are stored only in your browser's localStorage
- The source code is open - you can review all security aspects

**You're good to go! 🚀**
